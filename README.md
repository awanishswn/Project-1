# Coin Address Management Module

## Overview

This module provides basic functionality for handling coins in a blockchain context. It supports creating, minting, burning, depositing, withdrawing, and transferring coins between accounts. Each account can have a balance of coins, and the module ensures the integrity and validity of transactions.

## Key Components

### Structures

- **`Coins`**: Represents a coin with a value (`val`) of type `u64`.
- **`Balance`**: A key structure that holds the `Coins` for an account.

### Constants

- **Error Codes**:
  - `ERR_BALANCE_DOES_NOT_EXISTS`: Code for when a balance does not exist (101).
  - `ERR_BALANCE_EXISTS`: Code for when a balance already exists (102).
  - `E_HAS_INSUFFICIENT_BALANCE`: Code for insufficient balance (1).
  - `EALREADY_HAS_BALANCE`: Code for already having a balance (2).
  - `E_IS_EQUAL_ADDR`: Code for trying to transfer to the same address (4).

### Functions

- **`mint(val: u64) -> Coins`**: Creates new coins with the specified value.
- **`burn(coin: Coins)`**: Burns the specified coins (removes them).
- **`creating_balance(acc: &signer)`**: Initializes a balance of zero coins for the given account.
- **`balance_does_exists(acc_addr: address) -> bool`**: Checks if a balance exists for the given address.
- **`balance(owner: address) -> u64`**: Retrieves the balance of the specified address.
- **`depositing(acc_addr: address, coins: Coins)`**: Deposits coins into the specified account's balance.
- **`withdraw(acc: address, value: u64) -> Coins`**: Withdraws a specified amount from the account and returns the coins.
- **`transfer(from: &signer, to: address, amount: u64)`**: Transfers a specified amount of coins from one account to another.

## Usage

1. **Creating a Balance**: Use `creating_balance` to initialize an account with a zero balance.
2. **Minting Coins**: Use `mint` to create new coins.
3. **Depositing Coins**: Use `depositing` to add coins to an account's balance.
4. **Withdrawing Coins**: Use `withdraw` to take coins out of an account's balance.
5. **Transferring Coins**: Use `transfer` to move coins between accounts.

## Error Handling

- Ensure balances exist before performing operations like depositing or withdrawing.
- Check for sufficient balance before withdrawal.
- Prevent transfers to the same address.

## Example

```rust
// Create a new balance for an account
let signer = ...; // Obtain signer
coin_addrx::BasicCoins::creating_balance(&signer);

// Mint some coins
let coins = coin_addrx::BasicCoins::mint(100);

// Deposit coins into the account
coin_addrx::BasicCoins::depositing(signer::address_of(&signer), coins);

// Withdraw coins from the account
let withdrawn_coins = coin_addrx::BasicCoins::withdraw(signer::address_of(&signer), 50);

// Transfer coins to another account
let recipient_addr = ...; // Specify recipient address
coin_addrx::BasicCoins::transfer(&signer, recipient_addr, 25);
